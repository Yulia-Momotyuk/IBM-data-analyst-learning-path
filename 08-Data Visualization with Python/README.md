# Data Visualization with Python

## About this Course
One of the key skills I developed as a data analyst was the ability to tell a compelling story by visualizing data and findings in an approachable and meaningful way. I learned how to use software tools to extract insights, better understand data, and support more effective decision-making.

The main goal of the Data Visualization with Python course was to teach how to transform raw data into clear and informative visualizations. During the course, I worked with several Python libraries, including Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Folium, to create charts, plots, and interactive maps that made complex data easier to interpret.
