# Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python

## About this Course

The purpose of this course was to introduce **relational database concepts**  
and apply foundational knowledge of the **SQL language** in a data science context.  

The course focused on **hands-on, practical learning** by working with:
- Real databases  
- Real-world datasets  
- Real data science tools  

Throughout the course, I:
- Created a database instance in the **cloud**
- Built and ran **SQL queries** using real data
- Learned how to access databases from **Jupyter Notebooks** using **SQL and Python**

## Final Course Assignment
This folder contains data files and a Jupyter Notebook script that demonstrates use of a variety of SQL commands to query the three datasets.  
* _Census_Data.csv_ contains six socioeconomic indicators of public health significance and a “hardship index,” by Chicago community area, for the years 2008 – 2012. For more detailed information, see the [data description](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/Census-Data-Selected-socioeconomic-indicators-in-C/kn9c-c2s2).  
* _Chicago_Crime_Data.csv_ reflects reported incidents of crime (with the exception of murders where data exists for each victim) that occurred in the City of Chicago from 2001 to present, minus the most recent seven days. For more detailed information, see the [data description](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-present/ijzp-q8t2).  
* _Chicago_Public_Schools.csv_ shows all school level performance data used to create CPS School Report Cards for the 2011-2012 school year. For more detailed information, see the [data description](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Education/Chicago-Public-Schools-Progress-Report-Cards-2011-/9xs2-f89t).  
* _Chicago_Datasets_PeerAssign-v5.ipynb_ contains the script with ipython-sql code, which is used to query the datasets after they were loaded into a Db2 database on IBM Cloud.
