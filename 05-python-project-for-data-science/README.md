# Python Project for Data Science

## About this Course
For this project, I assumed the role of a **Data Scientist / Data Analyst** working for a new startup investment firm  that helps customers invest their money in stocks.  
My task was to extract financial data like **historical share prices** and **quarterly revenue reports** from various sources  
using Python libraries and web scraping techniques.  

After collecting this data, I visualized it in a dashboard to identify **patterns and trends**.  
The stocks I analyzed included **Tesla, Amazon, AMD**, and **GameStop**.
