# Python Project for Data Science

## About this Project
For this project, I assumed the role of a **Data Scientist / Data Analyst** working for a new startup investment firm  that helps customers invest their money in stocks.  
My task was to extract financial data like **historical share prices** and **quarterly revenue reports** from various sources  
using Python libraries and web scraping techniques.  

After collecting this data, I visualized it in a dashboard to identify **patterns and trends**.  
The stocks I analyzed included **Tesla, Amazon, AMD**, and **GameStop**.

### Course Structure

- [x] **Intro to Web Scraping Using BeautifulSoup**  
In this lab, I learned how to use `BeautifulSoup` to extract data from HTML tables into a DataFrame.  

**Environment Setup:**
```bash
pip install bs4  
pip install requests
```

- [x] **Extracting Stock Data Using a Python Library**

In this lab, I used the yfinance Python library to obtain historical stock data.
This was followed by a graded quiz to test the results.

* **Environment Setup**
```python
!pip install yfinance
!pip install pandas
```

- [x] **Extracting Stock Data Using Web Scraping**

In this lab, I applied web scraping techniques to obtain financial data from a web page using BeautifulSoup.
A graded quiz followed to validate the extraction process.

* **Environment Setup**
```python
!pip install pandas
!pip install requests
!pip install bs4
!pip install plotly
```

- [x] **Analyzing Historical Stock/Revenue Data and Building a Dashboard**

In this assignment, I extracted and visualized stock data in the form of interactive graphs.
This allowed for better decision-making based on identified data trends.

* **Environment Setup**
```python
!pip install yfinance
!pip install pandas
!pip install requests
!pip install bs4
!pip install plotly
```
