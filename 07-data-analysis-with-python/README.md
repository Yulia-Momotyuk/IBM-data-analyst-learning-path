# Data Analysis with Python

##  Assignment Scenario: Real Estate Price Prediction

In this assignment, I took on the role of a **Data Analyst** working at a **Real Estate Investment Trust**.  
The organization plans to start investing in **residential real estate** and needs insights into housing market prices.


### Objective

My task was to **predict the market price of a house** based on various features, such as:
- Square footage  
- Number of bedrooms  
- Number of floors  
- And other relevant attributes  

Using these features, I performed **data analysis and built predictive models** to estimate housing prices.


### Task Details

- A **template notebook** was provided to guide the process  
- The assignment included **10 structured questions**, which I completed using Python and data science tools  
- Techniques used included **data exploration, visualization**, and **machine learning** for regression-based prediction  

#### Dataset Used in this Assignment
The dataset contains house sale prices for King County, which includes Seattle. It includes homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015. This dataset is taken from Kaggle. It was also slightly modified for the purposes of this course.
