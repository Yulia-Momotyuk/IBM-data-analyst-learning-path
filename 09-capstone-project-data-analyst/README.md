# Capstone Project: Data Analyst

## About this Project
In this capstone project, I applied various data analytics skills and techniques that I had learned in the previous courses of the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate program. I assumed the role of an Associate Data Analyst who had recently joined a company and was presented with a business challenge that required analysis of real-world datasets.

I completed tasks such as collecting data from multiple sources, performing exploratory data analysis, cleaning and preparing the data, conducting statistical analysis, and uncovering insights through data mining. I also created visualizations — including charts and plots — and built an interactive dashboard to communicate the findings effectively.

The project concluded with the preparation of a complete data analysis report, including an executive summary tailored to the stakeholders of the organization. My work was assessed based on both the process I followed throughout the data analysis workflow and the quality of the final deliverables.
