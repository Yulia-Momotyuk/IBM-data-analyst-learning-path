# Data Analyst Career Guide and Interview Preparation

## About this Course
This course helped me understand the role of a data analyst and the career paths available in the field of data analytics. I learned how to lay a strong foundation for a job search, including how to analyze job postings, write a targeted resume, and build a professional portfolio.

I explored what to expect in typical interview processes, the different types of interviews (technical, behavioral, case-based), and how to prepare for them effectively. Additionally, I learned strategies for presenting myself professionally during interviews, including common question frameworks and personal storytelling techniques.
